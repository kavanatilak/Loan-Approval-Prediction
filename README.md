**Loan Prediction Analysis** 
**Overview** 
This project aims to predict if a customer will be provided with a loan using Decision Tree and XGBoost model. This project is done as a part of Kaggle Playground series 
The dataset used for this analysis is included in the repository. 
The project follows a structured approach to building a loan status prediction model. 
The stages include: 
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the dataset's structure, distribution of features, and identifying patterns. 
2. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any inconsistencies in the data.
3. Data Transformation: Transforming categorical variables and preparing the data for modeling.
4. Model Building and Evaluation: Developing a Decision Tree and XGBoost model to predict loan status and evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics.

The notebook and the dataset can be found in the "**master**" branch
